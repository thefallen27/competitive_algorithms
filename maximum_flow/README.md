The input for the programs here is the same we used for BFS algorithm. In this case the graph is big (100 nodes, 376 edges) and we put all three implementations for finding the maximum flow to the test. Ford - Fulkerson finished in all the cases and produced a result. As the source and sink were getting further and further apart, the Edmonds - Karp implementation was getting slower and slower. The reason is its usage of the BFS algorithm for finding the augmenting paths. Edmonds - Karp is more suitable for sparse, moderate sized graphs, with few edges. Dinic's algorithm implementation was the fastest out of them all! For more on the respective advantages and disandvantages of the three implementations, have a look at our study, linked in the README.md file outside of the repository.

The code implemented here finds the convex hull structure that encloses all 100 points as those are given as an input read from the convex_hull_input.txt file.

While the cpp and rust implementations are providing the results as the points that if connected, create the convex hull, the python implementation uses the mathplotlib library to graphically portray it!

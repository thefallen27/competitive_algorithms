The algorithm implemented here is very efficient and fast. It employs both the BFS and DFS algorithm to minimize the search for augmenting paths, thus making it faster than other naive augmenting path algorithms.

It also uses auxiliary vectors (in C++ and Rust) to minimize the space complexity which contributes a lot to the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

The programs employ the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to 
find a pattern inside a text file. There are two files that you can 
choose to search in. The first file contains over 7200 words of 
lorem ipsum while the second one contains 1,000,000 
characters used for DNA sequencing.

The programs return success and the position the pattern has been found.
In case of multiple occurences, the program will return multiple
positions from the input file.
